### Problem Statement : Nutrition and Performance Planner
### Description : Design an app that combines personalized workout routines with nutrition planning to optimize athletic performance based on individual health data
### Theme : Sports & Fitness

We are making a application  which will help users take care of their health genuinely. We are going to make a dedicated website about it where you can learn how to use the app. The app, although in its prototype state, performs four main functions. It can give you a well organised Workout Planner along with some tips on Nutrition. Not only that it has a built in Experience system which consists of XP points that can be spent on the in game store to buy certain gym equipments and accessories. It will also consist of an AI Chatbot named ChatFit, which will help users with any query they have.

### More additions to the README file will be made and instructions for use will be given in due course.
